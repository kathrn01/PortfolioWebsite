	   <h1>Hi there, welcome to my portfolio.</h1>
	   <p>My name is Katharine. I enjoy learning about software development, and more recently, web development (this website is the product!).</p>

	      <h1> About Me </h1>
	         <p>Aside from software development, my interests are in art, design, and antique/vintage items like books and magazines. I enjoy photography and oil painting, and learning about interior design and architecture.<br>
		   If I were to pick a favourite aspect of software development (from my experiences) I would choose UX/UI planning and implementing. I'm always inspired by thinking about what the end-user will see and interact with.</p>

	      <h1> This website </h1>
	         <p>When beginning my job search, I noticed many roles were looking for developers with front-end tools, which I lacked experience with. I decided to re-learn HTML and CSS in the last few months, and I'm working on incorporating other tools. 
			 This website is a work in progress and I look forward to adding new features as I learn. </p>
        <h1> GradeTracker </h1>
           <p>GradeTracker is my first personal project built with Swift, SwiftUI, and Core Data. It allows a user to add terms, then courses, and then syllabus items for each course. 
		   The user can set a goal grade for a course and the app will adjust the target grade for all of that course's syllabus items based on what grades are needed to achieve the goal.
		   It's a tool that I always thought would come in handy when I was a student, and I'm really enjoying the process of planning/adding in features that some of the programs I used for similar purposes lacked.</p>
        <h1> Academic Group Project </h1>
            <p>In a software engineering course at university, four other students and I built an Android application with Java and HSQLDB that allows users to rate and review video games. 
		   We used agile development principles like peer reviews, sprints, user stories, and retrospectives.</p>
